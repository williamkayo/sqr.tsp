## Analyze IADT functions
Hereafter, for each classes give function to be tested. Remember that all functions does not have to be tested, some code can be checked by a simple inspection or an analyse, another code can be validated by definition (rules, etc) the others function can be tecsted by unit tests, integration tests or validation tests (IADT: Inspect, Analyse, Define, Test). 

| Validation Mode |   Why ? When ?  |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| I: Inspect | No test needed, just a simple static test (visual) on a subset of classes (commentaries, indentation, etc.) |
| A: Analyze | Not easy to test but the algorithm is well know and can be check by a static analyze |
| D: Def/Dem | You can Demonstrate the function or by Definition the function needs not test (generate code, call functions, etc.)|
| T: Test | the function can be easily test |

### Class City

| Function      |     I A D T     |        Comment |
| :------------ | :-------------: | :------------- |
| distanceToCity |  |  | 
| getX |  |  | 
| getY |  |  | 
| toString |  |  | 

### Class Tour

| Function      |     I A D T     |        Comment |
| :------------ | :-------------: | :------------- |
| containsCity  |  |  |
| getCity  |  |  |
| getDistance  |  |  |
| getFitness  |  |  |
| setCity  |  |  |
| tourSize  |  |  |
| toString  |  |  |

### Class Population

| Function      |     I A D T     |        Comment |
| :------------ | :-------------: | :------------- |
| getFittest  |  |  |
| getTour  |  |  |
| populationSize  |  |  |
| saveTour  |  |  |

## Functions to test now

### Class City

```Java
public double distanceTo(City city)
```

### Class Tour

```Java
public int getDistance()
```

### Class GA

```Java
public static Population evolvePopulation(Population pop)
```

## Tricks & tips

- Start with simple classes (models, libraries, etc) at the end make test into complex classes (classes with multiple relations)
- Never test auto generate code
- Never test creator (its a design problem)
- Use @Test before each testFunction !
- You can test a function than throws an exception with the argument: expected
```Java
@Test(expected=Exception.class)
```
